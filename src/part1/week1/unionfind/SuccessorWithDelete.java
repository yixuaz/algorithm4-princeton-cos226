/**
 * Union-find with specific canonical element. Add a method find() to the union-find data type so that find(i)
 * returns the largest element in the connected component containing i.
 * The operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all take logarithmic time or better.
 *
 * For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9},
 * then the find() method should return 99 for each of the four elements in the connected components.
