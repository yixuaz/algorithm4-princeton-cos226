 *Dutch national flag. Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color.
 *  The allowed operations are:
 * swap(i, j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.
 * color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucket i.
 *
 * The performance requirements are as follows:
 * At most n calls to color().
 * At most n calls to swap().
 * Constant extra space.
